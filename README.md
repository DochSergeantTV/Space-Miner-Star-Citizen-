Dear miners, 

I wrote you a program with which you can determine the value of a stone directly. 
You can also write an order for your miner crew so that you don't get confused anymore. 
Anyone who likes to mine often should definitely use this tool.   

To use it, just download the .exe.
If you want to continue working on the project, then download the folder


This program is free to use and you can continue to edit and publish it. 
However, I would appreciate support.  

Happy mining
